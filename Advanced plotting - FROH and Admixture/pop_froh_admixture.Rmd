# Data wrangling

To prepeare right vcf file to convert it to map and ped files you need
to: \* filter out indels and keep just SNPs \* keep only biallelic SNPs

We can do this with plink2:

```{r}
# Filter out indels and keep only biallelic SNPs
plink_filter <- paste("./plink2",
                      "--vcf eagle.vcf",
                      "--allow-extra-chr",
                      "--max-alleles 2",
                      "--min-alleles 2",
                      "--recode vcf",
                      "--out eagle_filtered")
system(plink_filter)
```
##### Only plink2 has max and min alleles


Now we need to convert it with plink to map and ped format:

```{r}
#recode in plink
plink_vcf <- paste("./plink2",
                    "--vcf eagle_filtered.vcf",
                    "--allow-extra-chr",
                    "--recode",
                    "--out eagle")
system(plink_vcf)
```

Import the ped and map files:

```{r}
# Import the ped and map files
eagle.ped <- read.table("eagle.ped", header = FALSE, sep = " ")
#separator is tabulator
eagle.map <- read.table("eagle.map", header = FALSE, sep = "\t")
```

Import the metadata about samples:

```{r}
TableS1 <- read.table("TableS1.csv", sep = ";", header = TRUE)
View(TableS1)
```


We would like to rewrite FID columns with the sample groups, that are in
TableS1.csv file in CO column. We can match the samples with the
TableS1.csv file with the Name column and the first column in ped file:

```{r}
# Match the samples and rewrite the FID column (V1) with CO values
eagle.ped$FID <- TableS1$CO[match(eagle.ped$V1, TableS1$Name)]

# Overwrite V1 with the new FID values and remove the extra column
eagle.ped$V1 <- eagle.ped$FID

# Remove the last column
eagle.ped$FID <- NULL

# Save the updated .ped file
write.table(eagle.ped, "eagle_groups.ped", quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
```
##### We like to copy CO column from TableS1 to eagle.ped and we match the column V1 in eagle.ped file with CO and rewrite Name based on that. ped format doesn't accept this CO column so we have to remove it after matching. CO file contains the population name, i.e names of countries 

We would like to rewrite the map file with the chromosome names instead
of the ENA accession numbers. We can do this with the mapping file
chromosoms_eagle.csv. We retrieve this data based on the paper about the
reference genome of the golden eagle
(<https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8499043/>).

```{r}
#read csv for chromosomes
chr_mapping <- read.table("chromosoms_eagle.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")

# Replace V1 in map_data using the mapping file
eagle.map$V1 <- chr_mapping$Chromosome[match(eagle.map$V1, chr_mapping$ENA_accession)]

# Check for unmatched chromosomes (optional)
unmatched <- eagle.map$V1[is.na(eagle.map$V1)]
if (length(unmatched) > 0) {
  cat("Unmatched chromosomes:", unique(unmatched), "\n")
}

# View the updated map data
head(eagle.map)

# Save the updated .map file
write.table(eagle.map, "eagle_groups.map", quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
```

# Runs of homozygosity

### Important for theoretical part of the exam!!!

## Inbreeding

-   **Definition**: Inbreeding occurs when individuals that are
    genetically related mate, leading to increased homozygosity (i.e.,
    the presence of two identical alleles at a genetic locus).
-   **Effects**:
    -   **Positive**: Fixing beneficial traits in a population (e.g., in
        selective breeding).
    -   **Negative**: Increased likelihood of expressing recessive
        deleterious alleles, reducing fitness (inbreeding depression).

# Froh (Fraction of the Genome in Runs of Homozygosity)

-   **Runs of Homozygosity (ROH)**: Continuous stretches of the genome
    where all loci are homozygous (e.g., `AA AA AA` or `GG GG GG`).
-   **Froh Calculation**:

$F_{ROH} = \frac{\text{Total length of ROH segments (bp)}}{\text{Total length of the genome (bp)}}$

-   A higher Froh indicates greater inbreeding.

-   By calculating Froh, we can infer the genetic contribution of
    relatedness in a population.

Runs of Homozygosity (ROH) and measures of inbreeding are important
concepts in population and evolutionary genetics. They provide insight
into the genetic health, population structure, and demographic history
of a species or population.

**What Are Runs of Homozygosity (ROH)?** \* Definition: ROH are
continuous stretches of DNA where the alleles are homozygous (identical)
across all SNP loci. These regions are typically inherited from common
ancestors. \* Importance: \* Reflects past inbreeding. \* Can identify
areas of the genome under selection. \* Highlights demographic history,
such as bottlenecks or isolation.

**Causes of ROH**

-   Inbreeding: Offspring of related individuals inherit large
    homozygous segments from common ancestors.
-   Population Bottlenecks: Small population sizes result in reduced
    genetic diversity, increasing the likelihood of ROH.
-   Selection: Regions under strong positive selection may show extended
    homozygosity.

**Inbreeding Coefficient (FROH)** \* Definition: FROH is the proportion
of the genome in ROH relative to the total genome size. \* Formula:

$F_{ROH} = \frac{\text{Total length of ROH segments (bp)}}{\text{Total length of the genome (bp)}}$

#### **Using Manhattan Plots to Visualize ROH**

-   **What They Show**:

    -   Manhattan plots visualize the percentage of SNPs in ROH across
        chromosomes.

    -   Each chromosome is represented on the x-axis, and the percentage
        of SNPs in ROH is on the y-axis.

-   **Interpretation**:

    -   High peaks suggest chromosomes with more SNPs in ROH, indicating
        regions of high homozygosity.

    -   Patterns can reveal genomic hotspots of inbreeding or selection.

#### **Violin Plots to Represent FROH**

-   **Purpose**:

    -   Violin plots display the distribution of FROH values across
        individuals or groups.

    -   They combine a boxplot with a density plot, showing both summary
        statistics and data distribution.

-   **Interpretation**:

    -   Wide areas indicate a high frequency of specific FROH values.

    -   Narrow areas or tails show outliers.

#### **Example Output**

Here\'s a breakdown of typical output for ROH classes:

| Class   | Length Range (Mb)                | Total ROHs | \% of Genome Covered |
|----------|------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Class 1 | <2 Mb< 2 \, \text{Mb}\<2Mb       | 500        | 10%                  |
| Class 2 | 2−4 Mb2 - 4 \, \text{Mb}2−4Mb    | 300        | 15%                  |
| Class 3 | 4−8 Mb4 - 8 \, \text{Mb}4−8Mb    | 200        | 20%                  |
| Class 4 | 8−16 Mb8 - 16 \, \text{Mb}8−16Mb | 50         | 10%                  |
| Class 5 | >16 Mb> 16 \, \text{Mb}\>16Mb    | 10         | 5%                   |

### **Interpreting the Classes**

1.  **Class-Specific Patterns**:

    -   **Class 1 (short ROHs)**:

        -   Reflect ancient events or population bottlenecks.

    -   **Class 5 (long ROHs)**:

        -   Indicate recent inbreeding.

2.  **Application to Froh**:

    -   $F_{ROH}$​ can be calculated for each class to assess the
        contribution of ROHs of different lengths to inbreeding.

3.  **Visualization of Classes**:

    -   Use violin or boxplots to compare ROH contributions across
        classes or populations.

**Measures of Inbreeding**

-   **Froh ( Fraction of the Genome in Runs of Homozygosity)**: The
    proportion of the genome that is in ROH.
-   **Fhom (Homogeneity of Runs of Homozygosity)**: The average size of
    ROH segments in the genome.
-   **Fhet (Heterozygosity)**: The proportion of heterozygous loci in
    the genome.

**Interpreting ROH and Inbreeding Measures**

-   **High Froh**: Indicates recent inbreeding or a small effective
    population size.
-   **High Fhom**: Suggests ancient inbreeding or selection on specific
    genomic regions.
-   **Low Fhet**: Indicates reduced genetic diversity or inbreeding.

**Applications of ROH Analysis**

-   **Conservation Biology**: Assessing genetic health and diversity in
    endangered species.
-   **Human Genetics**: Studying the genetic basis of complex traits and
    diseases.
-   **Animal Breeding**: Selecting for desirable traits while minimizing
    inbreeding depression.

**Challenges in ROH Analysis**

-   **Data Quality**: Accurate genotyping and variant calling are
    essential for identifying ROH.
-   **Population Structure**: Accounting for population substructure and
    relatedness is crucial for interpreting ROH patterns.
-   **Statistical Methods**: Choosing appropriate thresholds and
    parameters for ROH detection and analysis.

**Conclusion**

Runs of Homozygosity and measures of inbreeding provide valuable
insights into the genetic history and health of populations. By
analyzing ROH patterns, researchers can uncover the effects of
inbreeding, selection, and demographic events on genomic diversity.
Understanding these concepts is essential for conservation efforts,
breeding programs, and studies of human genetic variation.

## Perform runs of homozygosity (ROH) analysis in R with detectRUNS package.

### Sliding window:

```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, results='hide'}
slidingRuns <- slidingRUNS.run(
  #genotypeFile = genotypeFilePath, 
  #mapFile = mapFilePath, 
  genotypeFile = "eagle_groups.ped",
  mapFile = "eagle_groups.map",
  windowSize = 15, 
  threshold = 0.05,
  minSNP = 20, 
  ROHet = FALSE, 
  maxOppWindow = 1, 
  maxMissWindow = 1,
  maxGap = 10^6, 
  minLengthBps = 250000, 
  minDensity = 1/10^3, # SNP/kbps
  maxOppRun = NULL,
  maxMissRun = NULL
) 

##### This works directly with map and ped files

# Inspect the structure of slidingRuns
str(slidingRuns)

# Check chromosome data
unique(slidingRuns$chrom)
```

### Consecutive runs:

```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, results='hide'}
consecutiveRuns <- consecutiveRUNS.run(
  genotypeFile = "eagle_groups.ped",
  mapFile = "eagle.map",
  minSNP = 20,
  ROHet = FALSE,
  maxGap = 10^6,
  minLengthBps = 250000,
  maxOppRun = 1,
  maxMissRun = 1
)
```
##### Try to repeat the plots for consecutive runs


### Summary of runs:

```{r}
summaryList <- summaryRuns(
  runs = slidingRuns, mapFile = "eagle_groups.map", genotypeFile = "eagle_groups.ped", 
  Class = 6, snpInRuns = TRUE)
```


```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
#See all the posibilities for summaryList
summaryList$summary_ROH_percentage
summaryList$summary_ROH_count
summaryList$summary_ROH_mean_class
summaryList$summary_ROH_percentage_chr

```

### Top runs:

```{r}
topRuns <- tableRuns(
  runs =  slidingRuns, mapFile = "eagle_groups.map", genotypeFile = "eagle_groups.ped", 
  threshold = 0.7)

topRuns
```

## Plotting ROH

### Manhattan plot:

```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
plot_manhattanRuns(
  runs = slidingRuns, mapFile = "eagle_groups.map", genotypeFile = "eagle_groups.ped")
```


### Violin plot

```{r}

  runs = slidingRuns, mapFile = "eagle_groups.map", style = "FrohBoxPlot")
```


# ADMIXTURE 

Admixture is a program that uses a model-based maximum likelihood approach to estimate individual ancestries from multilocus SNP genotype datasets. The program assumes that the sample is a mixture of K ancestral populations. The program estimates individual ancestries and also the allele frequencies in the K ancestral populations. The program is also available as a graphical interface, but we will use it through R. The function is implemented in the dartR package. The function is called gl.run.admixture. The function requires the data in the form of a matrix, where the columns are the samples and the rows are the SNPs. The K parameter specifies the number of ancestral populations. The num.k.rep parameter specifies the number of repetitions for each K. The exec parameter specifies the name of the executable file. The numreps parameter specifies the number of iterations. The burnin parameter specifies the number of iterations to be discarded as burnin. The function returns a list of results. The function also draws a graph of the cross-validation error. 


First we need to convert map and ped files to bed format. 

```{bash}
./plink.exe --file eagle_groups --make-bed --out eagle_groups
```

For running admixture we need more powerful computer, so we used our server with 64 cores and 256GB of RAM. 

For admixture we can set a lot of things: 
* number of groups (K)
* number of threads (j)
* the output that is saved also in the file


admixture --cv filtered_03_LD.bed 2 > admixture_log2.out (base command) (number represents number of groups, here is 2)

for K in 1 2 3; do admixture --cv filtered_03_LD.bed $K -j64 | tee log${K}.out; done (for creating files for multiple group amounts in desired range, here is 1 to 3)
grep -h CV log*.out (for viewing the CV errors in all existing logs)

```{bash}
for K in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10; do admixture --cv eagle_groups.bed $K -j64 | tee log${K}.out; done
grep -h CV log*.out
```

## Scree plot

First we need to see the CV errors for each K. Based on that we can create scree plot which will help us to determine the optimal number of groups based on elbow method.

```{r scree_plot, echo=FALSE}
#Load the cv_error file
cv_error <- read.table("cv_error.csv", header=TRUE, sep=";")

#Plot the scree plot
cv_error %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = CV_error, x = K)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("K") +
  ylab("Cross-validation error") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Prepearing the data for admixture Q plotting

```{r q_files, echo=FALSE}
# Initialize an empty data frame
all_data <- tibble()

# Read the sample metadata from fam file
samples <- read.table("eagle_groups.fam", header=FALSE)

# Loop through K values
for (k in 2:5) {
  # Read the admixture Q file
  data <- read_delim(paste0("eagle_groups.", k, ".Q"),
                     col_names = paste0("Q", seq_len(k)),  # Correct column names
                     delim = " ")

  # Add sample names and the current K value
  data$sample <- samples$V2
  data$k <- k

  # Reshape the data and ensure Q levels are consistent
  data <- data %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Q"),
                 names_to = "Q",
                 values_to = "value") %>%
    mutate(Q = factor(Q, levels = paste0("Q", seq_len(k))))  # Reset factor levels for Q

  # Combine the data
  all_data <- bind_rows(all_data, data)
}
```


## Plotting the results of ADMIXTURE

Basic plot: 

```{r basic_admixture_plot}
#plotting
all_data %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(x=sample,y=value,fill=factor(Q))) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity",position="stack") +
  xlab("Sample") + ylab("Ancestry") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set1",name="K",
                    labels=seq(1:5)) +
  facet_wrap(~k,ncol=1)
```

Add lines to separate groups: 

```{r}
# Merge `samples` and `all_data` to ensure alignment
aligned_samples <- samples %>%
  filter(V2 %in% unique(all_data$sample)) %>% # Only keep samples present in the plot
  mutate(order = match(V2, unique(all_data$sample))) # Map sample order to x-axis position

# Calculate group boundaries for vertical lines
group_boundaries <- aligned_samples %>%
  group_by(V1) %>%
  summarize(position = min(order)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Add vertical lines to the plot
all_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sample, y = value, fill = factor(Q))) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  geom_vline(data = group_boundaries, 
             aes(xintercept = position - 0.5), 
             color = "black", size = 0.8) + 
  xlab("Sample") + ylab("Ancestry") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1", name = "Q", labels = seq(1:5)) +
  facet_wrap(~k, ncol = 1, strip.position = "left") +
  theme(strip.placement = "outside")  # Move facet labels outside the plot area

```


Reordering samples by group


```{r}
# Define the desired population order
desired_order <- c("IS", "GL", "NO", "DK", "ES", "TU")

# Reorder and align the samples and groups
samples <- samples %>%
  mutate(
    V1 = factor(V1, levels = desired_order), # Reorder groups
    V2 = factor(V2, levels = unique(V2[order(match(V1, desired_order))])) # Reorder samples within groups
  )

# Align `all_data` to the reordered samples
all_data <- all_data %>%
  mutate(sample = factor(sample, levels = levels(samples$V2)))

# Calculate group boundaries for vertical lines
group_boundaries <- samples %>%
  mutate(order = as.numeric(V2)) %>% # Get numeric x-axis positions
  group_by(V1) %>%
  summarize(position = max(order) + 1, .groups = "drop") # Get last position of each group

# Plot with vertical lines and simplified code
all_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sample, y = value, fill = factor(Q))) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  geom_vline(data = group_boundaries, 
             aes(xintercept = position - 0.5), 
             color = "black", size = 0.8) + 
  xlab("Sample") + ylab("Ancestry") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1),
    strip.placement = "outside",
    strip.background = element_blank()
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1", name = "Q", labels = seq(1:5)) +
  facet_wrap(~k, ncol = 1, strip.position = "left")

```
